# Coffee-And-Wifi-Web-APP
The "Coffee and WiFi" app is a Python program that uses the Yelp API to find coffee shops with WiFi in a specified location. The program prompts the user for their location and then displays a list of nearby coffee shops with WiFi, along with their ratings and phone numbers.

To run the app, you will need to obtain a Yelp API key and install the following dependencies:

Requests: pip install requests
Python Dotenv: pip install python-dotenv
Once you have installed these dependencies and obtained a Yelp API key, you can run the program using the command line interface. The program prompts you to enter your location and then displays a list of nearby coffee shops with WiFi, sorted by their ratings. You can then choose a coffee shop from the list and view its phone number.

This app can be useful for anyone looking for a place to work or study while enjoying a cup of coffee. However, it is important to use the app responsibly and in compliance with the Yelp API terms of service.
